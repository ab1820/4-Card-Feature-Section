## Overview

In this challenge, I decided to challenge myself and face head on CSS Grid. It has been something that I have been avoiding lately, but it is necessary to know these days for design and web layouts. Time to learn! And this challenge would be a perfect example for the use of CSS Grid.

- If I am missing anything, or you see anything that could use some fixing, please don't hesitate to throw out some advice! :)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

- With this challenge I knew I couldn't tackle CSS Grid without watching some videos on it. What helped me was watching the Wes Bos CSS Grid course and following along with the videos, while creating this challenge. It has actually made it a lot easier for me to learn and understand by doing the process along with the videos. 
I am extremely happy with how it turned out.
